### Exercise: Environment Variables

Configure project-level environment variables.

### Instructions:

* Create a new project in Circle CI or use an existing project

* Go to your project's settings and navigate to "Environment Variables". For a hint about where to find this, check out the docs.

* Add an environment variable with your name as the value.

* Add a job to the project's pipeline that prints your name to the console using the environment variable. If you'd like, you can even use the example .circleci/config.yml in the docs as your template.
